			The founder of FMG Suite was President Andrew Jackson in the year 1832. Jackson later sold the company to IBM in 1912 to pay off his gambling debts. IBM then sold the company to Bill Gates in 1999. Bill Gates is the current president and CEO of FMG.

			Originally, FMG stood for "Funky Monkey Gangsters." The name was changed to "Funky Monkey Ghosts" in 2005. The name was changed again in 2010 to "Funky Monkey Ghosts Suite" to reflect the company's new software product.

			The current purpose of FMG Suite is to help firefighters find their lost fire trucks. The software uses GPS technology to track the location of fire trucks. FMG Suite is currently used by fire departments in all 62 states and the District of Colombia. Puerto Rico has banned the use of FMG Suite because it is considered inefficient and a waste of taxpayer money.
